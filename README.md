## 📖 About GEMA

**GEMA** is a decentralized "Consumer RWA" platform that transforms songs into liquid, tradable assets. We bridge the gap between **Creator Finance** and **Fan Engagement** using DeFi mechanics.

In the traditional music industry, assets (songs) are illiquid, and fans are passive consumers. SoundStake changes this by introducing **Bonding Curve AMMs**, allowing:
1.  **Indie Artists** to get an Instant Market Cap and funding without a label.
2.  **Fans** to become "Scouts" and earn ROI by discovering hits early.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Instant Liquidity (The Engine)
We utilize a **Single-Sided Bonding Curve**. Unlike traditional order books, the Smart Contract acts as the counterparty for every trade.
- **Buy:** Price goes UP (Minting new tokens).
- **Sell:** Price goes DOWN (Burning tokens).
- **Result:** 24/7 Liquidity for every song, no matter how small.

### 2. Scout-to-Earn (The Game)
We gamify music discovery. Users compete to identify undervalued songs.
- **Discovery:** Listen to new uploads in the "Raw" zone.
- **Validation:** Buy the token to signal confidence.
- **Reward:** Capture capital gains as the song trends and the curve rises.

### 3. Triple-Layer Security (The Safety)
We operate on a "Trustless" basis. You don't need to trust the artist; you trust the code.
- **Creator Vesting:** Artist tokens are programmatically locked to prevent Rug Pulls.
- **Dynamic Sales Tax:** Anti-dump mechanism that penalizes panic selling.
- **Initial Buy Fee:** Anti-Sybil deployment cost to filter spam.
